            <p>
              Have you used Flutter but wanted to take it to the next level? <br />
              <br /> Tired of building apps that becomes messy, hard to manage and want a
              streamlined way of building apps? <br />
              <br />
              <strong>I understand, Iâ€™ve been there!</strong>
              <br />
              <br /> This is not a course where I will go over how to use the basics such as a Row,
              Column and so on, but instead teach you how to build robust applications from scratch.
              <br />
              <br />
              What I teach in this course is <strong>knowledge</strong> that will take you from
              building something that just works to something that is <strong>robust</strong> and{" "}
              <strong>production ready</strong>!
              <br />
              <br /> Go from more simple concepts such as UI to the more complex layers such as
              architecture, error handing, testing and much more.
              <br />
              <br /> This is primirily targeted towards intermediates BUT if you have a base
              knowledge of Flutter then it is for you as well!
              <br />
              <br />
              Do you wish you were rich?
              <br /> Do you wish you were successful?
              <br />
              <strong>
                This course cant help with that! But it will teach you about state management ðŸ˜Ž

              I made this course as a main goal of giving structure when learning Flutter. Instead
              of taking <strong>multiple months</strong> or <strong>even years</strong> to get to a
              solid understanding the course will walk you through that, right away.
              <br />
              <br /> Learning things like <strong>Testing, Architecture, Animations</strong> are
              crucial for building good and reliable apps, and is something that can be very hard to
              get right.
              <br />
              <br /> Iâ€™ve tought on YouTube with almost <strong>two million views</strong>, done
              consulting for business and clients. Iâ€™ve taken what I teach{" "}
              <strong>business and clients</strong> in to a course so more people can get something
              out of it!
              <br />
              <br /> If I would teach this in a one to one meeting that would be up in the price
              range of <strong>$2500 or more</strong>.
              <br />
              <br /> The question always comes down to, how serious are you?

              After spending so much time on both this course and teaching over 3 years on YouTube
              and other areas I am confident that this will be worth it.
