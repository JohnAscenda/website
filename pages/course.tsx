              Have you used Flutter but want to get to the next level? <br />
              <br /> Tired of writing code that becomes messy, hard to manage,
              and want a streamlined way of building apps? <br />
              <br />
              <strong>I understand, Iâ€™ve been there!</strong>
              <br />
              <br /> I won't teach you how to use a Row or Column (you should
              already be familiar with that). Instead, I will teach you how to
              build robust applications from scratch.
              <br />
              <br />
              This course will give you the <strong>knowledge</strong> you need
              to build <strong>production-ready</strong> apps!
              <br />
              <br /> I'll guide you through the most important steps, such as
              building the UI, choosing the right architecture, handling errors,
              testing, and much more.
              <br />
              <br />
              This is an intermediate-level course. BUT if you have a basic
              knowledge of Flutter, then it is for you as well!
              <br />
              <br />
              Do you wish you were rich?
              <br /> Do you wish you were successful?
              <br />
              This course can't help with that!{" "}
              <strong>But it will teach you about state management ðŸ˜Ž</strong>

              I made this course as the main goal of giving structure when
              learning Flutter. Instead of taking{" "}
              <strong>multiple months</strong> or <strong>even years</strong> to
              get to a <strong>solid understanding</strong>, the course will
              walk you through that, right away.
              <br />
              <br /> Learning things like{" "}
              <strong>Testing, Architecture, Animations</strong> are crucial for
              building good and reliable apps which is something that can be
              very hard to get right.
              <br />
              <br /> Iâ€™ve taught on YouTube with almost{" "}
              <strong>two million views</strong>, done consulting for{" "}
              <strong>businesses and clients</strong>. I've taken all this
              knowledge and created the course I wish I had when I started.
              <br />
              <br /> If I would teach this in a one-to-one meeting that would be
              up in the price range of <strong>$2500 or more</strong>.
              <br />
              <br /> The question always comes down to, how{" "}
