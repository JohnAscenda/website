The repository-service is **not** a new pattern, but it is **powerful**. I have
personally used it for quite some time, and now I wanted to share it with you
all.

In this post, we will see real examples of implementing the repository-pattern
and also learn some pros and cons the pattern has.

## Some background

To understand the repository-service pattern, we first need to understand what a
repository and what a service is.

- A repository is a class that will handle getting data into and out of your
  database (data store). For example, if you have a `Dog` model, you will
  probably also have a `DogRepository`.
- A service is a class that will combine multiple repositories to provide more
  complex domain data. For example, if we have a `Dog` and a `CatRepository`, we
  might have an `AnimalService` to get all our animals and aggregate data.

You might already imagine a con of this pattern and, that is **"boiler-plate"**
code, or, in simple terms, a bunch of god damn code ðŸ˜¡.

## The practical application

Let's move away from the background and get into the coding!

To better explain this, we will keep the animals. I love animals, why not use
them to explain some code!

Below we have two endpoints, one for `dog` and one for `cat`. I made them in
singular, to better grasp the concept.

```js
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Fluffy",
  "species": "cat",
  "age": 2,
  "breed": "persian"
}
```

```js
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Bobby",
  "species": "dog",
  "age": 4,
  "breed": "Keeshound"
}
```

## The repository in repository-service pattern

I will ignore the part where we create the models/entities for the above JSON,
just imagine for now that we have it.

Now two typical repositories would look something like this

```dart
class DogRepository {
  Future<Dog> getDog() async {
    // Do the required code to fetch it with whatever package or solution you want.
    final dog = fancyFetchLogicForDog();
    return dog;
  }
}
```

```dart
class CatRepository {
  Future<Dog> getCat() async {
    // Do the required code to fetch it with whatever package or solution you want.
    final cat = fancyFetchLogicForCat();
    return cat;
  }
}
```

### âœ… Simplicity

Notice that both our repositories are very simple in terms of implementation.
This is one of the reasons why I love repositories.

Now that we have done the above code, we just need to also create the services.
Yes... that is right, one of the cons is now incoming...

We need to create 3 services:

1. `DogService`
2. `CatService`
3. `AnimalService`

The reason for this is because depending on what we want in the application the
layer we want to use the appropriate service.

Now how does these look?

## ðŸ§™ The magic of services

I will keep it simple and ignore the `DogService` and `CatService` for now. The
reason for this is because they will simply call respective repository and
potential error handling, conversion, etc.

Instead let's focus on the `AnimalService`!

```dart
class AnimalService {
  final DogRepository _dogRepository;
  final CatRepository _catRepository;

  AnimalService(this._dogRepository, this._catRepository);

  Future<List<Animal>> getAllAnimals() async {
    try {
      final dog = await _dogRepository.getDog();
      final cat = await _catRepository.getCat();
      return [dog, cat];
    } catch (e) {
      throw e;
    }
  }

  Future<double> getAverageAnimalAge() async {
    try {
      final dog = await _dogRepository.getDog();
      final cat = await _catRepository.getCat();
      final animals = [dog, cat];
      final averageAge = animals.map((animal) => animal.age).reduce((a, b) => a + b) / animals.length;
      return averageAge;
    } catch (e) {
      throw e;
    }
  }
}
```

On purpose, I **didn't** do any kind of error handling to keep the code to a
minimum. But if you would like to see that, make sure to **share the article**.
This is something I cover in-depth in my course, but it requires a quite large
blog post! For something free, I made a personal project open-source that
implements [this pattern](https://github.com/RobertBrunhage/budget_together).

<div className="blog_post_component">
  <emailSignup color={"var(--secondary-bg-color)"} />
</div>

## The end result

Thanks to this pattern we have gotten a clean way to interact with our backend
data.

```dart
// Imagine this has some fancy ui and this would be the method call.
Future<void> getAverageAnimalAge() async {
  final averageAnimalAge = await animalService.getAverageAnimalAge();

  setState(() {
    _averageAnimalAge = averageAnimalAge;
  });
}
```

But what I love the most is the **freedom** to do our error handling just as we
want and still keep the calling side clean.

## Ending gratitude

I would like to both shout-out Andrea Bizotto from with his astounding article
on the
[repository pattern](https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-repository-pattern/)

And Matthew Jones about his
[service-repository article](https://exceptionnotfound.net/the-repository-service-pattern-with-dependency-injection-and-asp-net-core/)
that I **highly** recommend reading through.
