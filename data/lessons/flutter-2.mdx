# Flutter 2.0 announcement

Here are some of the major announcements that I picked up during the Flutter 2.0 Announcements! A detailed post can be found from the <a href="https://medium.com/flutter/whats-new-in-flutter-2-0-fe8e95ecc65" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Flutter team</a>.

## Portable Framework

The first announcement they did was that they are not marketing themselves as a mobile framework anymore but instead as a Portable framework. Which means that there are now support for 6 platforms on the stable channel.

* Androud
* iOS
* Web
* Windows
* Mac
* Linux

## 6000 issues Closed

Not more here more than almost 6000 issues closed in the Flutter repo which to me is an insane amount!

## Google Internal Usage

They talked about how Flutter is used internally at Google with over 30 teams using it. These are in things like Stadia, Google Pay app and so on!

## Ubuntu and Microsoft

There are two announcements here which that both Ubuntu is using it now for their Ubuntu installer and that they have contributed a ton to the Flutter codebase.

For Microsoft, they have contributed code over the past months to better support foldable devices. Personally I don't have one but it's really cool to see as this also in terms helps the support for other Foldable devices other than the Microsoft ones.

## Toyota

Now Toyota announced that they are using Flutter for their infotainment system and this means in term that Flutter also supports Embedded on top of all these other platforms. Usaged from big companies like these is a pretty huge milestone!

## Dart 2.12

The major features released here are:

* Sound Null Safety
* Dart FFI

They also talk about future Dart features and how they are implemented, this brought up the topic of Meta Programming, which sounds interesting but we will see how that unfolds!

## Tooling

`Flutter fix` is a new command that will automatically migrate depricated API to the new implementations which should in term help a lot!

They also added additional tooling for when you get different layout errors to open the `Layout Inspector` in that specific place!


## Google Mobile Ads SDK

I have been developing with Flutter for over 3 years and this is something I have wanted ever since I built my first app. It's currently in beta and can be found <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/google_mobile_ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. It will let us have native ads in our applications which in term will improve the the application feel and potentially increase the revenue as well!

## Upcoming News

The touched a bit on a Flutter Template that will be released to help having a good structure in a newly created application. This in my opinion will help a lot as the Flutter Counter application is mostly focused towards completly new Flutter developers.
